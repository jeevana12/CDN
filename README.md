How content Delivery network works?

Today, the India vs Pakistan match is happening. Imagine if the match tickets were sold only in one store in Delhi. People from all over India would rush there, creating huge crowds, long queues, and frustration. Many wouldn’t even get tickets.

But what if tickets were sold in multiple stores across different cities? People would buy from their nearest store, reducing crowding, making the process faster and smoother for everyone.

🔹 A CDN is a network of multiple servers worldwide that helps deliver content faster and more efficiently.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗮 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼 𝗶𝘀:
✅ Recorded and broken into small 2-3 second video chunks.
✅ Stored in the main server of the streaming platform (like JioHotstar, etc.).
✅ Copied and distributed by the CDN across multiple servers worldwide.

Now, when you stream the match, the video bytes don’t come from the main server. Instead, they are fetched from the nearest CDN server based on your geographical location.

✅ No Buffering – Streams smoothly without lag.
✅ Faster Load Times – Content is served from the nearest location.
✅ No Overload on Main Server – Traffic is distributed efficiently.
✅ Better User Experience – You enjoy the match without interruptions

So, just like how multiple ticket counters prevent overcrowding, a CDN prevents server overload and ensures smooth content delivery

Next time you enjoy a lag free match, you know who to thank – CDN😅
